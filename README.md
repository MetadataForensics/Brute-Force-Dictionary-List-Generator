## Downloading

Navigate to the Brute Force Dictionary List Generator.exe above. Select "More file actions" on the right, shown by an "..." icon, and choose "Download".

When downloading, you may me met with a download issue requiring you to trust the application to open it. This is because the application is new and not commonly downloaded. Selecting "More actions" will allow you to "Keep" the file and complete the download. 

## Usage

You may also be required to take additional steps when running the tool the first time, through Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. In the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen select "More info" and "Run anyway" to launch the application the first time. 

## Generating a Brute Force Dictionary List

Run the application, browse to your input .txt file, browser to your output folder for your custom brute force dictionary list, and select "Process." Your custom brute force dictionary list will be created and saved in your output location!
